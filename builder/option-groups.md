# Managing Option Groups

The **Option Groups** list is the main dashboard for OptionBay. Navigate here via **Products → Options** in your WordPress admin menu.

## Page Header

![The page header showing the title, Add new group link, Import and Export buttons](../public/img/option-groups-header.png)

The top of the page contains a WordPress-style heading row with several quick-action buttons:

- **Option Groups** *(title):* The page heading. This is always visible.
- **Add new group:** Click this link to open a fresh [Addon Builder](/builder/addon-builder) and start creating a new option group from scratch.
- **Import:** Click to expand an inline Import panel directly below the header. Drag and drop or upload a previously exported `.json` file to restore or migrate your option groups.
- **Export:** Click to expand an inline Export panel below the header. Select which entities (`Option Groups`, `Inventory Pools`, `Plugin Settings`) to bundle and download as a single `.json` file for backups or migrations.

::: info Import & Export
Both panels toggle inline — clicking one closes the other. For full instructions on format, compatibility, and best practices, see the dedicated guide.

## Status Filters

![Status filter tabs showing All, Published, Draft, and Trash with item counts](../public/img/option-groups-filters.png)

Above the table you'll find quick filter tabs that let you narrow the list by status. Each tab shows its item count in parentheses:

- **All** — Shows every group regardless of status (Published + Draft).
- **Published** — Only groups that are currently live and visible on product pages.
- **Draft** — Only groups that are saved but hidden from customers.
- **Trash** — Groups that have been soft-deleted. This tab only appears when the trash contains at least one group.

Click any tab to filter the list instantly — no page reload required.

---

## The List Table

Each row in the table represents one Option Group. By default, you see several columns:

- **Title:** The internal name of the group. Click the title text to open it in the [Addon Builder](/builder/addon-builder) for editing.
- **Fields:** A count of how many fields (inputs, swatches, etc.) are configured inside the group.
- **Assigned To:** A summary of where the group is routed — e.g., "All Products", "3 categories", "2 products".
- **Status:** A **live toggle switch**. Flip between Published and Draft with a single click — the change takes effect immediately via the API, no page reload needed.

### Column Visibility Customization

![Column picker popover open, showing the list of toggleable columns](../public/img/option-groups-columns.png)

You can fully customize which columns are displayed using the **column picker settings menu** — click the vertical dots icon (⋮) at the top-right of the table header. The dropdown allows you to selectively show or hide any of the following columns:

- **Fields** — Field count within the group.
- **Assigned To** — Assignment routing summary.
- **Status** — Live toggle switcher.
- **Created By** — The WordPress user who originally created the group.
- **Created At** — The date and time the group was first saved.
- **Updated By** — The WordPress user who last modified the group.
- **Updated At** — The date and time of the most recent update.

Toggle any column on or off. Your preferences will persist automatically for your session.

## Searching Groups

Use the **search box** in the top-right area (next to the View Inventory button) to find groups by name:

- Type your search query into the text input.
- Press **Enter** on your keyboard, or click the **Search groups** button.
- The table filters to show only groups whose titles match your query.
- Clear the search box and press Enter again to reset the view.

## Row Actions

![A table row being hovered, showing the inline action links](../public/img/option-groups-row-actions.png)

Instead of old-school text links hidden under the title, OptionBay uses a sleek, modern inline actions column with quick-action icons:

**Normal view (All / Published / Draft):**
- **Edit (Pencil Icon):** Click to open the group in the [Addon Builder](/builder/addon-builder).
- **Duplicate (Copy Icon):** Instantly duplicate the group — copying all fields, settings, and assignment rules — with "(Copy)" appended to the title.
- **Delete (Trash Icon):** Soft-deletes the group, moving it to the Trash tab.

**Trash view:**
- **Restore (Undo Icon):** Move the group back to its previous status (Published or Draft).
- **Delete Permanently (Trash Icon):** Erase the group and all its assignment rules from the database. This action cannot be undone.

::: warning Permanent Deletion
The "Delete Permanently" action is irreversible. A confirmation modal will always appear before final deletion, with the focus defaulting to the "Cancel" button for safety.
:::

---

## Bulk Actions

To perform an action on multiple groups at once:

1. **Select groups** by checking the boxes on the left of each row. Use the header checkbox to **Select All** visible groups on the current page.
2. **Choose an action** from the **Bulk actions** dropdown:
   - *Normal view:* **Publish**, **Draft**, or **Move to Trash**.
   - *Trash view:* **Restore** or **Delete Permanently**.
3. Click **Apply**.

A count indicator below the dropdown shows how many groups are currently selected (e.g., "3 of 12 selected").

![Bulk action confirmation modal asking to confirm moving 3 groups to trash](../public/img/option-groups-bulk-confirm.png)

A confirmation modal always appears before any destructive action (Move to Trash, Delete Permanently). For destructive actions, the modal uses a red "Confirm" button and auto-focuses the "Cancel" button to prevent accidental deletion.

---

## Pagination

Results are paginated at **20 groups per page**. The pagination controls appear both above and below the table:

- **Item count:** Shows the total number of groups matching the current filter (e.g., "12 items").
- **← Previous / Next →:** Navigate between pages.
- **Page indicator:** Displays the current page and total pages (e.g., "Page 1 of 3").

## View Inventory

![The View Inventory button in the controls area](../public/img/option-groups-inventory-btn.png)

Click the **View Inventory** button (📦 icon) in the top-right controls area to open the **Global Stock Inventory** modal directly from the list page — without navigating away. This gives you a quick overview of all your stock pools, their current quantities, and linked options.

::: tip Quick Stock Access
This is a shortcut to the same inventory data available in the full Stock management section. Use it when you just need a quick glance at inventory levels while managing your groups.
