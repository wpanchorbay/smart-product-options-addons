# Conditional Visibility

**Conditional Visibility** lets you show or hide fields based on what the customer has already selected in the same Option Group. Use it to build branching option flows that adapt in real time as the customer interacts.

## How It Works

Each field has a **Visibility** tab in the Addon Builder. You configure a set of **rules** (conditions) that are evaluated against the other fields in the same group. If the conditions are met, the field is either **shown** or **hidden** depending on your action setting.

On the **frontend**, the JavaScript engine re-evaluates all conditions in real time as the customer interacts. Fields appear and disappear without any page reload.

On the **backend** (at cart submission), the same conditions are re-evaluated server-side by `ConditionEvaluator.php` to ensure:
- Hidden fields are not validated as required
- Hidden fields do not contribute to pricing calculations
- Hidden fields are not saved to the cart or order

---

## Setting Up Conditions

Inside the **Visibility** tab of any field:

### Step 1 — Enable Conditions

Toggle **Enable Conditional Logic** to on.

### Step 2 — Choose the Action

| Action | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Show this field when…** | Field is hidden by default; shown only when conditions are met |
| **Hide this field when…** | Field is visible by default; hidden when conditions are met |

### Step 3 — Set Match Type

| Match Type | Logic |
|------------|-------|
| **ALL** (AND) | Every single rule must be true for the action to trigger |
| **ANY** (OR) | At least one rule must be true for the action to trigger |

### Step 4 — Add Rules

Click **Add Rule**. Each rule has three parts:

| Part | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Field** | Select which other field in the group to watch |
| **Operator** | The comparison to perform |
| **Value** | The value to compare against |

## Supported Operators

| Operator | Meaning | Works With |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| `==` (equals) | Value exactly matches | All fields |
| `!=` (not equals) | Value does not match | All fields |
| `>` (greater than) | Numeric comparison | Number fields |
| `<` (less than) | Numeric comparison | Number fields |
| `>=` (greater than or equal) | Numeric | Number fields |
| `<=` (less than or equal) | Numeric | Number fields |
| `contains` | Value appears in the selection | Checkbox (multi), text |
| `not contains` | Value does not appear in selection | Checkbox (multi), text |
| `is empty` | No value submitted | All fields |
| `is not empty` | A value has been submitted | All fields |

## Examples

### Show "Engraving Text" only if "Add Engraving?" is checked

```
Action: Show this field when...
Match: ALL

Rule 1:
  Field:    Add Engraving?
  Operator: == (equals)
  Value:    1
```

The `1` value is what a single checkbox submits when checked.

---

### Hide shipping note if "In-store pickup" is selected

```
Action: Hide this field when...
Match: ALL

Rule 1:
  Field:    Delivery Method
  Operator: == (equals)
  Value:    pickup
```

---

### Show "Rush fee" warning only if quantity is 10 or more

```
Action: Show this field when...
Match: ALL

Rule 1:
  Field:    Quantity Needed
  Operator: >= (greater than or equal)
  Value:    10
```

---

### Show discount field if EITHER coupon code OR loyalty badge is selected

```
Action: Show this field when...
Match: ANY

Rule 1:
  Field:    Promo Code
  Operator: is not empty

Rule 2:
  Field:    Loyalty Tier
  Operator: contains
  Value:    gold
```

---

## Initial Render (No Layout Shift)

When the product page loads, OptionBay sets the initial visibility of each conditional field **server-side** before the page renders. Fields set to "show when…" start hidden (CSS class `ob-hidden`). This prevents the flash of an incorrect state while JavaScript initialises.

---

## Conditions and Validation

Fields that are hidden by conditions are **fully skipped** during:
- Required field validation at add-to-cart
- Pricing calculations
- Cart session storage
- Order item metadata

A hidden field never appears on the cart page, checkout, or order — even if it has a required setting or a price attached.

::: tip Cross-Group Conditions Not Supported
Conditions can only reference **other fields within the same Option Group**. You cannot create conditions that watch fields in a different group.
